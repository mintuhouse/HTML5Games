      <h3>Why HTML5?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Cross-platform
        <li> Open standard <!-- NOTE: No need to pay royalities to  use -->
        <li> No additional plugins required
        <li> Features like high performance 2D and 3D graphics, offline asset storage, rich audio APIs, geo-location API and socket-based networking let you create compelling modern games
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        We will go into details later 

        It's official: with HTML5 today the browser has become a full-fledged gaming platform. Features like high performance 2D and 3D graphics, offline asset storage, rich audio APIs, and socket-based networking let you create compelling modern games with a reach like never before. Connect with users wherever they are by creating HTML5 games that can be played in browsers across desktop or mobile devices. HTML5 has the tools you need to create amazing games that engage with users seamlessly.
        Reference: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/gaming

        We sincerely feel that 10 minutes is too less to describe how wonderful HTML5 is!
        We will try to discuss a few features that we feel are important

        <h3>Web Sockets</h3><!-- Use vertical slides to describe same topic-->

          <p>Google's Ian Hickson—the HTML5 specification lead says:
            <blockquote> 
              Reducing kilobytes of data to 2 bytes…and reducing latency from 150ms to 50ms is far more than marginal. In fact, these two factors alone are enough to make Web Sockets seriously interesting to Google. 
            </blockquote>

      <section>
        <h3>Polling vs Web Sockets</h3>      
        <ul>
          <li>With polling, the browser sends HTTP requests at regular intervals and immediately receives a response.
          <li>HTTP request and response headers contain unnecessary header information introducing latency
          <li>Also two connections are opened to create a full-duplex communication over half-duplex HTTP 
          <li>Web Sockets define a full-duplex communication channel that operates through a single socket over the Web.
       <ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Web Socket Handshake</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Client and server upgrade from HTTP protocol during their initial handshake</li>
          <table>
            <thead>

          </table>
          <li>Both text and binary data can be sent on full-duplex after upgrade as data strings in JavaScript</li>
          <li>Data is framed minimally with just 2 bytes
          <li>Text frames use a terminator and binary frames use length prefix
        </ul>

        <h3>Comet vs WebSockets</h3>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>Web application which request real-time stock data from RabbitMQ message broker was created.
            <li>Comet uses half-duplex polling to get updates
              <img src="img/comet-websockets.png" id="comet-websockets"/><!-- TODO: References for each img -->
            <li>Using LiveHTTP Headers (a Firefox add-on to show header traffic), the total overhead of request and response headers was observed to be 871 bytes!

        var gameArea = document.getElementById('gameArea'); 
        var newWidth = window.innerWidth;

      <h3>Other Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Audio and Video :  the tracks are loaded the same way all the other game effects are loaded with XMLHttpRequests and the arraybuffer response type and stored in buffers. They are played using <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> HTML5 tags.
        <li>Local Storage :  HTML5 allows to store normalized relational database which can be explored using SQL. You can cache content or use a web app to use when you’re not connected to the Internet. An e-commerce HTML5 application could allow people to add items to buy later and then finish the purchase when they are back online.

      <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Connectivity - HTML5 apps usually require an internet connection to at least load, if not use
        <li>Performance - native apps are faster
        <li>Doesn't include digital rights management (DRM) technology to prevent copying
        <li>Support for different HTML5 video formats - differ in browsers
        <li>Security Concerns
        <li>Evolving and no complete support
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">
        <p>Digital rights management (DRM) is a class of access control technologies that are used by hardware manufacturers, publishers, copyright holders and individuals with the intent to limit the use of digital content and devices after sale. DRM is any technology that inhibits uses of digital content that are not desired or intended by the content provider. DRM also includes specific instances of digital works or devices. Companies such as Amazon, AT &T, AOL,Apple Inc., BBC, Microsoft, Electronic Arts and Sony use digital rights management. </p>

      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML5 is still considered as work-in-progress and has features which are not compatible with all the browsers.
        <li>HTML5 does not differentiate between mobile/PC platforms and avoids plugin installations
        <li>Hence, HTML5 will soon emerge as a new standard for rich media applications over the internet
      </ul>

      Advantages:
        Web standard as opposed to platform specific code
        HTM5 is the foundation of Mozilla's Firefox OS

    </section>

    <section>
      Disadvantages:
        HTML5 is currently being stabilised, the web inventor added, and a lot of work is being done around security and access control.
        It's often simply out-performed by its rivals, particularly where the app is one that needs to deliver speed or a familiar app-like experience.
        In June, German social games developer Wooga abandoned its HTML5 efforts, citing problems such as discoverability (people aren't used to setting up links as homescreen icons), performance (native apps are faster), and connectivity (HTML5 apps usually require an internet connection to at least load, if not use).
        Facebook ditched HTML5 for iOS apps. For faster performance and integrate Camera & Messenger apps into main app
        The DRM (digital rights management) problem with multimedia content. While many people are opposed to DRM, broadcasters tend not to be in their ranks, because that would involve irking their content suppliers. HTML5 does not in itself support DRM for video.
        The underlying issue is that HTML5 is a proper standard, being developed by multiple stakeholders. I hesitate to call this a 'problem', because that's how standards are and how they mostly should be made. But it does put the nascent technology at a strong disadvantage against platforms that are more directly controlled and easily progressed.
        Why, at this point, should they think of addressing HTML5 early on? The best reason is its cross-platform nature: but right now, HTML5 apps generally get out-performed on each platform by native apps.
        I'm not saying HTML5 is dead on smartphones. Far from it. It's working now, and it will only get better.
        Advice for developers
        If HTML5 works for you, then go for it. As I said in the article, it does work on phones, just not as well as native apps tend to. This will improve over time, and how tolerant you are of waiting is specific to your circumstances.
        HTML5 is a set of related standards. This is key to understanding the problems that beset HTML5. While the idea of one HTML5-powered app working across all platforms is a nice pipe dream, the reality is currently a bit more complicated. 
        According to Appcelerator's Michael King, there is a 30% differential on feature support across browsers. In other words, some HTML5 features may be supported in Chrome, but not in Safari or Firefox. This problem carries into mobile browsers as well. This undermines the idea that developers can create one HTML5 app and deploy it across all platforms.
        Facebook has abandoned its HTML5-heavy app for one built from scratch with Apple's iOS SDK. Facebook's rating in the app store has jumped from 1.5 starts to 4 stars only a few weeks after launching the new app. While the development of the mobile web is clearly in Facebook's business interest because HTML5 supports payments for mobile web apps, it's not clear that it's Apple or Google's interest. Consumers strongly favor apps to the mobile web at the moment, and Apple and Google take a cut of native app transactions.
        "It's not that HTML5 is bad. I'm actually, long-term, really excited about it" His regret was not that Facebook spent two years dithering on HTML5, but that it spent two years on HTML5 when it wasn't ready, or, as he put it, "it just wasn't there." As we've argued before, HTML5 is the more promising technology in the long-term, which Zuckerberg alluded to in his interview. - Mark Zukerberg
